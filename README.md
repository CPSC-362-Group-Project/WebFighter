# Attack Simulation:
- Currently in testing ...
- Attack simulation function named simulateAttack() can be found in [click here](./js/enemy.js)
- The function uses random number to simulate attack, it can be adjusted accordingly to make game harder.
- The larger the range of the if conditions, the more probability the actions will happen
Ex: increasing the range of number to make enemy launch more attacks
